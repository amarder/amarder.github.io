description: "Minimizing Tufte's principles of data graphics."
---

Edward Tufte's [The Visual Display of Quantitative Information][1] is
the bible of data visualization.  Tufte gives five principles to the
theory of data graphics.

> 1. Above all else show the data.
> 2. Maximize the data-ink ratio.
> 3. Erase non-data-ink.
> 4. Erase redundant data-ink.
> 5. Revise and edit.

Of these five, I think the first two principles are most important:

1. Above all else show the data.
2. Maximize the data-ink ratio.
