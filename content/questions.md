This step-by-step procedure for asking good questions and giving
helpful answers is an adaptation of
[How To Ask Questions The Smart Way][original].

1.  Define the problem.

2.  Try to solve the problem.

    Read the manual.  Read the FAQ.  Search the archives of the forum
    where you might ask for help.  Search the Web.  Ask a skilled
    friend. "Take your time.  Do not expect to be able to solve a
    complicated problem with a few seconds of Googling."

3.  Ask for help.

    When asking for help, clearly communicate the original problem,
    and how your attempted solutions failed.  Display what you have
    learned in trying to solve the problem.  If you are posting to a
    public forum, read through some archived messages to get a sense
    of the forum.  Use meaningful and specific subject headers.  If
    you are asking a new question, change the subject of the
    conversation to reflect the new question.  This will facilitate
    future searches of the archive.  Send plain text mail, with line
    lengths of at most 80 characters.  Never send closed proprietary
    formats like Microsoft Word or Excel.  Provide a reliable way to
    reproduce the problem.  Describe the problem symptoms
    chronologically, not your hunches as to what causes the problem.
    Don't ask yes-or-no questions unless you want a yes-or-no answer.
    Be explicit about your question.  Focus your respondent's effort
    and put a bound on the time and energy necessary to help you.

4.  If you get a helpful response, give thanks.

    Follow up with a brief note on the solution.  Modify the subject
    of the mail to be "Subject - FIXED".  Say what action solved the
    problem, do not repeat the problem's history.  Name those who
    helped.  Mention blind alleys at the end of the message to inform
    those who might be curious.

    If you don't get the response you were hoping for, don't react
    like a loser.  When someone let's you know you've asked a stupid
    question, he is acting out of concern for you and his community.
    "If you can't manage to be grateful, at least have a little
    dignity, don't whine, and don't expect to be treated like a
    fragile doll just because you're a newcomer with a theatrically
    hypersensitive soul and delusions of entitlement."  If you didn't
    get an answer, don't repost your question instead consider paying
    for support.

# How To Answer Questions in a Helpful Way

"Be gentle. Problem-related stress can make people seem rude or
stupid."  Ask probing questions to elicit more details.  "If you're
going to answer the question at all, give good value.  Don't suggest
kludgy workarounds when somebody is using the wrong tool or approach.
Suggest good tools.  Reframe the question.  Help your community learn
from the question.  Improve the documentation and FAQ so nobody has to
answer this question again.  Describe how you arrived at your
solution, teach a man to fish.
