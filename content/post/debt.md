I recently read [a New Yorker article][new-yorker] about Mr. Money
Mustache. I appreciate his bad ass approach to financial freedom, it's
inspiring and enviable. I enjoy being frugal and I also enjoy spending
money. I think the key is finding the right balance between spending
money today versus saving for tomorrow. I find myself drawn towards
solutions like Mr. Money Mustache's extreme frugality,
[inbox zero][inbox-zero], and the [magic of tidying up][tidying-up].

I think [technical debt][technical-debt] is a case where making the
calculation makes sense. Similar with [Getting Things Done][gtd].
