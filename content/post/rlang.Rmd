I've been trying to wrap my head around [Programming with dplyr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/programming.html). This post describes what I perceive to be a disconnect between the documentation and the source code of the `rlang` package. I think understanding this disconnect may help me understand how `rlang` works under the hood.

First let's take a look at the documentation:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(rlang)

get_help <- function(...) {
    h <- help(...)
    f <- utils:::.getHelpFile(h)
    lines <- capture.output(tools::Rd2txt(f))
    return(lines)
}

lines <- get_help(UQ)
cat(lines[10:22], sep = "\n")
```

Now let's look at the source code for `UQ()`, `!!`, and `UQE()`:

```{r}
library(rlang)

UQ
`!!`
UQE
```

It's weird to me that the `!!` operator is identical to the `UQE()` function and not identical to the `UQ()` function. I'm not the only one confused by this, check out this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/tidyverse/rlang/issues/256).

Here's my question, where in the `rlang` source should I be looking to understand how the `!!` operator is evaluated in a quoting context?

PS I'm not posting this question on Stack Overflow because it's more of a discussion question than a programming question.
